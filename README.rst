metameta
========

This is the code for a talk I gave at the
`May 2016 Django London Meetup <https://www.djangolondon.com/meetups/2016-05-10/>`_.
It demonstrates the difference between Django's various ``Meta`` classes and true
metaclasses through some contrived examples with dynamic forms :)

You can run the code simply with a ``vagrant up`` once you've installed
`Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`_.
